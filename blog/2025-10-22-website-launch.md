Today, we announce the launch of NewNepal.org - a public platform built by Nepali youths, for all Nepali youths. Our mission is to connect Nepali youth across geographical, ethnic, ideological, religious, and political divisions while providing a safe space for critical dialogue about Nepal's future.

This platform will serve as a hub for youth engagement, featuring debates on critical issues, youth group registries, corruption databases, news portals, and polling to understand perspectives on nation-building topics.
