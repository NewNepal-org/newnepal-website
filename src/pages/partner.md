# Partner with NewNepal

NewNepal.org is a platform connecting GenZ groups and changemakers across Nepal to build a unified youth movement. Our mission is to create safe spaces for dialogue and drive positive transformation in our country.

We are seeking to collaborate with GenZ groups and changemakers across Nepal. We are attempting to fill several critical gaps in our youth movement, and we need your inputs to succeed.

## Why We Need Your Partnership

### 1. Unite Fragmented GenZ Groups

GenZ groups are fragmented, and they need to be united. For this, we have created a [registry](/genz-registry) so that groups and changemakers can find other like-minded groups and changemakers. We are requesting your team to send your information and agenda.

**Information we are asking from you:**
- Team name and logo
- Mission statement and description
- Focus areas and current activities
- Contact details (email, social media; will be made public.)
- Team agenda (PDF, word, or image format)
- Information in both English and Nepali (if possible)

### 2. Solidify Our Agendas Through Debate

To solidify our agendas, we are asking groups and changemakers to join our [weekly debates](/debate). In this way, we get deep into the details and come back understanding their strengths and weaknesses.

**Benefits of participation:**
- Engage in critical dialogue about Nepal's future
- Test and refine your ideas with fellow changemakers
- Build consensus on key issues facing our generation

### 3. Build a Corruption Database

To meet our main demand, we are starting a case-by-case [corruption database](/corruption). To date, no team has worked on this comprehensive approach. We are asking changemakers to join our effort to build this open-source case.

**Your contribution matters:**
- Share documented corruption cases from your region
- Help verify and cross-reference information
- Contribute to holding accountability across Nepal

## Get Involved

If you have questions, please feel free to reach out to us through our [contact page](/contact) or directly reach out to our founder on Discord (username: `homo.novus`).

**Ready to partner?** We welcome:
- GenZ groups and youth organizations
- Individual changemakers and activists
- Anyone committed to Nepal's positive transformation

*Together, we can connect Nepali youth across all divisions and create the safe space for dialogue that our generation needs.*
