# About NewNepal.org

NewNepal.org is a Nepali youth organization founded in October 2025 to address common issues among GenZ groups. We were established to bolster depth of understanding of our agenda, link GenZ groups, promote coalition building, and build common strategies for moving forward.

Our platform is dedicated to creating a public space built by Nepali youths, for all Nepali youths. Our mission is to connect Nepali youth across geographical, ethnic, ideological, religious, and political divisions while providing a safe space for critical dialogue about Nepal's future.
