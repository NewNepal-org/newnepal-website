# Welcome to NewNepal.org

**A Digital Platform for Nepali Youth, by Nepali Youth.**

Welcome to NewNepal.org, a grassroots initiative founded in October 2025 to unite Nepali youth across all divisions—geographical, ethnic, ideological, religious, and political. We're building a safe digital space where young Nepalis, both at home and in the diaspora, can engage in meaningful dialogue about Nepal's future.

Our mission is to connect Nepali youth across all divisions and provide a safe space for critical dialogue about Nepal's future. [Read our full mission](/mission).

## What We're Building

- 🗣️ [**Weekly Debates**](/debate) - Structured debates on critical national issues to build consensus through healthy discourse
- 📋 [**GenZ Registry**](/genz-registry) - Directory of youth groups to facilitate coordination and collaboration
- 🔍 [**Corruption Database**](/corruption) - Centralized platform to document evidence and promote accountability
- 📰 **Youth News Portal** - Nation-building content while preventing misinformation
- 📊 **Polling & Surveys** - Understanding youth perspectives and informing public discourse

We believe in open collaboration and maintain as much content as possible in the public domain. Our code repositories, platform activities, and non-personal assets are publicly accessible to ensure transparency and community ownership. [Learn more about our approach](/mission).
